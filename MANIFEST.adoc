== Scale with less

In todays crazy world, world where the only value is business, business value,
the widely accepted and practiced way to scale you organization or system is to
scale by growth.

We add more people to organization to deliver faster, to scale.

We add more features to product, to make more money, to scale.

We add more servers, to respond faster, to scale.

We add layers of abstractions, to increase understanding. to scale.

But it doesn't have to be like this, you can scale with less.


== Repetition is learning (if it hurts do it more often)

== Make yourself unnecessary (automate)

== Back to the roots (understand the basic)

== You can't know everything (surround yourself with experts)

== If you can't change it, quit
